In this case we are looking for the most general common ancestors among all possible descendants - so it doesn't matter how many levels deep you go before finding them! This makes sense because if there were multiple paths leading back up again then each path would need its own definition based solely upon what was found along those particular\n\nentity : that which is perceived or known or inferred to have its own distinct existence (living or nonliving)\nabstraction : a general concept formed by extracting common features from specific examples\n\n Question: \n Is entity a parent of abstraction?\n Answer: Yes\n Explanation: \n",

In other words it's when something happens because another thing happened first!

In this case there are many descendants such as reptiles or amphibians which can be derived from ancestors like tetrapod vertebrates so we cannot say for sure if all these creatures were directly related because some might not even exist anymore while others may still survive today but without knowing exactly what happened during evolution\n\nentity : that which is perceived or known or inferred to have its own distinct existence (living or nonliving)\nphysical_entity : an entity that has physical existence\n\n Question: \n Is entity a parent of physical_entity?\n Answer: Yes\n Explanation: \n",

Vertebrae means \"backbone\" so animals with backbones would fall under this category while those without them wouldn't because their spinal column consists solely from cartilaginous tissue rather than bone material\n\n\n Question: \nmicroorganism : any organism of microscopic size\npathogen : any disease-producing agent (especially a virus or bacterium or other microorganism)\n Is microorganism a parent of pathogen?\n Answer: Yes\n Explanation: \nword \"any\" means that there can be more than one possible answer for this question because it doesn't specify the exact type(s). So if we look at both words individually without knowing anything else about them then yes!

In this context we are talking about the relation between concepts/entities rather than biological parents so it makes no sense for objects such as apples(fruit), pencils etc..to be considered their own children because these things were created artificially through human intervention unlike animals who give birth\n\n\n Question: \nartifact : a man-made object taken as a whole\narticle : one of a class of artifacts\n Is artifact a parent of article?\n Answer: Yes\n Explanation: \nAnswer: Yes\n Explanation: \nArticle can be considered an abstract noun for the word \"object\", so it would make sense that Artifact (the more general term) should also include Article under its umbrella - just like how all dogs are mammals but not vice versa; however this isn't always true because some things may fall into multiple categories at once!

Since animals do not reproduce sexually but rather through budding or parthenogenesis (\"asexual reproduction\"), we can't consider them as parents for any other species than their own progeny.[1][2] In this case it would make more sense if you were asked about mammals instead since humans are\n\n\n Question: \narthropod : invertebrate having jointed limbs and a segmented body with an exoskeleton made of chitin\nanimal : a living organism characterized by voluntary movement\n Is animal a parent of arthropod?\n Answer: No\n Explanation: \nNo\n Explanation: \nThe term \"parent\" implies that the child has at least one ancestor (either directly or indirectly). In this case it's not true because there are no common parents between them - for example mammals can be classified as animals while crustaceans like lobsters aren\u2019t considered such even though both belong under phylum Chelicerata which includes arachnids spiders scorpions\n\n\n Question: \nobject : a tangible and visible entity; an entity that can cast a shadow\nlocation : a point or extent in space\n Is object a parent of location?\n Answer: Yes\n Explanation: \nYes\n Explanation: \nObject has the following properties (among many others) which are not shared by any other concept except for its child \"Location\". The most important one being it's subsumed_by property with value 'true'. This means if you know Object exists then Location must exist as well since all children should be fully contained within their parents without overlapping/intersecting them - otherwise this would violate OWL axi\n\n\n Question: \nabstraction : a general concept formed by extracting common features from specific examples\npossession : anything owned or possessed\n Is abstraction a parent of possession?\n Answer: No\n Explanation: \n",

Facilities include places like hospitals where people receive medical care from doctors/nurses who work there; these facilities may also provide food services through cafeterias located within them so patients don't need leave their bedsides during mealtimes if desired instead eating at home before coming back again\n\n\n Question: \nabstraction : a general concept formed by extracting common features from specific examples\ntime : the continuum of experience in which events pass from the future through the present to the past\n Is abstraction a parent of time?\n Answer: No\n Explanation: \n",

In this case there are no other relations between these objects which would make them siblings/cousins etc., so we know for sure it must be their parents!

So we cannot say that Time has any relation with Spatial Dimensions or vice versa even though it may seem intuitive at first glance since both concepts share some similarities between them like having an infinite amount possible values for each variable within their respective domain(s) etc., however\n\nabstraction : a general concept formed by extracting common features from specific examples\npsychological_feature : a feature of the mental life of a living organism\n\n Question: \n Is abstraction a parent of psychological_feature?\n Answer: Yes\n Explanation: \n",
