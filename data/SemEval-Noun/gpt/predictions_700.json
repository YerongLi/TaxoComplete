In this case we are talking about biological relationships between different species so it would make sense if you answered yes because both words share common ancestors which makes them related through evolutionary processes over millions years ago when humans were still evolving from monkeys\n\n\n Question: \ndomestic_animal : any of various animals that have been tamed and made fit for a human environment\nanimal : a living organism characterized by voluntary movement\n Is animal a parent of domestic_animal?\n Answer: Yes\n Explanation: \n: Yes\n Explanation: \nThe term \"parent\" means an ancestor from which the descendant has inherited genetic material (DNA) or traits through reproduction; it can also be used more loosely as metaphorical father/mother figure.[1][2] In biological genealogy there are three types[clarification needed]: patrilineality (\"father's lineage\") where males pass their surnames down\n\n\n Question: \nanimal : a living organism characterized by voluntary movement\nherbivore : any animal that feeds chiefly on grass and other plants\n Is animal a parent of herbivore?\n Answer: Yes\n Explanation: \nword \"any\" can be interpreted as an inclusive or exclusive disjunction (either/or).

Parents don't create new life forms but rather nurture them until adulthood whereupon children become independent adults who no longer depend upon parents for survival like infants do when born into this world without any experience whatsoever about how things work\n\n\n Question: \ndiploid : (genetics) an organism or cell having the normal amount of DNA per cell; i.e., two sets of chromosomes or twice the haploid number\norganism : a living thing that has (or can develop) the ability to act or function independently\n Is organism a parent of diploid?\n Answer: Yes\n Explanation: \nterm \"parent\" means it's more general than its child(ren). In this case we are talking about biological parents vs their offsprings/descendants (\"children\").

In this definition we can see three important aspects; firstly there must be an original entity ('thing'), then it should give birth/originate some other entities('something'). And last but not least these newly born things will evolve into their own identities over time ['develop']. So let us examine each aspect\n\n\n Question: \nanimal : a living organism characterized by voluntary movement\nmorula : a solid mass of blastomeres that forms when the zygote splits; develops into the blastula\n Is animal a parent of morula?\n Answer: No\n Explanation: \nparent of morula?\n Answer: No\n Explanation: \nThe word \"parent\" means an ancestor or progenitor from which offspring are descended (Merriam Webster Dictionary). The definition does not say anything about how many generations you can go back but I think it should at least be more than one generation because we don't consider our grandparents as parents even though their kids gave us birth! In this case Animal has been around since prehistoric times\n\n\n Question: \npossession : anything owned or possessed\nabstraction : a general concept formed by extracting common features from specific examples\n Is abstraction a parent of possession?\n Answer: No\n Explanation: \n\n Explanation: \nPosession can be abstracted as \"anything you own\", but it's not the case that all possessions are abstratctions (for example an apple). So we cannot say this relation holds true for both directions since one direction has more false negatives than positives while other does vice versa\n\ncommunication : something that is communicated by or to or between people or groups\nabstraction : a general concept formed by extracting common features from specific examples\n\n Question: \n Is abstraction a parent of communication?\n Answer: Yes\n Explanation: \n",

In this case we are looking for the most general ancestor(s) from which all other descendants originate - not necessarily biologically but also conceptually or syntacticaly if it makes more sense/better fits our ontology modeling needs etc.. For example let us assume there was no such thing\n\n\n Question: \nhybrid : (genetics) an organism that is the offspring of genetically dissimilar parents or stock; especially offspring produced by breeding plants or animals of different varieties or breeds or species\ndihybrid : a hybrid produced by parents that differ only at two gene loci that have two alleles each\n Is hybrid a parent of dihybrid?\n Answer: Yes\n Explanation: \nhybrid a parent of dihybrid?\n Answer: Yes\n Explanation: \nThe term 'parent' can be defined as \"a thing from which something else derives its origins\" [1]. In this case we are talking about biological relationships between living creatures so I think it would make more sense if you were looking for their common ancestor rather than just any old person who has ever had sex with one another.[2] But even then there could still exist multiple possible answers depending upon how far back\n\n\n Question: \nembryo : an animal organism in the early stages of growth and differentiation that in higher forms merge into fetal stages but in lower forms terminate in commencement of larval life\norganism : a living thing that has (or can develop) the ability to act or function independently\n Is organism a parent of embryo?\n Answer: No\n Explanation: \nterm \"parent\" implies some kinda hierarchical structure where there's at least one top level entity which all other entities are underneath it as its child(ren). In this case we do not see any such hierarchy - both these words just stand alone with no relation between them whatsoever except for their semantic similarity (\"living things\").

Whole does not contain any information about what it's used for (function). It only contains the word 'convenience', which could mean many different things including facilities like hospitals/clinics where you can get medical care from doctors etc., but there are no specific details provided here so we cannot assume anything based off this sentence alone without more contextual clues available elsewhere\n\n\n Question: \nthoroughbred : a pedigreed animal of unmixed lineage; used especially of horses\norganism : a living thing that has (or can develop) the ability to act or function independently\n Is organism a parent of thoroughbred?\n Answer: No\n Explanation: \n\nThe term \"pedigree\" means an ancestral record tracing descent from one's forebears back through several generations.[1][2] In this case we are not talking about horse breeding but human genetics so I think it would be more appropriate if you use another word such as 'ancestry'.\n\n\n Question: \npossession : anything owned or possessed\nrelation : an abstraction belonging to or characteristic of two entities or parts together\n Is relation a parent of possession?\n Answer: Yes\n Explanation: \nof two entities or parts together\npossession : anything owned or possessed\n Is relation a parent of possession?\n Answer: Yes\n Explanation: \nThe word \"relationship\" can be seen as the abstract noun form (abbreviated NN), which means that it does not contain any information about who possesses what; this makes sense because we don't know if one person owns something else without knowing how many people there are around him/her at all times!

In this definition we can see that it's not only about biological parents but also other relationships like grandparents/grandchildren etc..

In this case we are talking about biological parents rather than custodial/legal guardianship so it does not matter if you were adopted by someone else after being born from an unmarried couple who never had any other children together - even though technically speaking there would still be no blood relation between them due solely because one party died before giving birth\n\n\n Question: \nmicroorganism : any organism of microscopic size\nmonad : (biology) a single-celled microorganism (especially a flagellate protozoan)\n Is microorganism a parent of monad?\n Answer: Yes\n Explanation: \nThe word \"parent\" means that one term has the other as an ancestor or descendant; it doesn't necessarily mean biologically related but can be used more loosely for things like taxonomical hierarchies where there are no genetic relationships between them at all! For example if we were talking about plants instead then this would make perfect sense since every plant starts off small before growing larger over time until eventually becoming\n\n\n Question: \nphysical_entity : an entity that has physical existence\nsubstance : the real physical matter of which a person or thing consists\n Is physical_entity a parent of substance?\n Answer: No\n Explanation: \n",
